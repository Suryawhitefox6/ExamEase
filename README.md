# ExamEase : Exam Alteration Helper - A Web-Based Solution for Exam Schedule Management

## Abstract
Efficient exam scheduling and management play a crucial role in academic institutions, ensuring seamless and structured examination processes. However, unexpected challenges such as faculty unavailability, last-minute changes, manual scheduling errors, and lack of real-time communication render traditional methods inefficient and error-prone. To address these limitations, the Exam Alteration Helper has been developed as a comprehensive, web-based solution that automates and optimizes various aspects of exam scheduling, including invigilation allocation, faculty-initiated swap requests, and schedule modifications. The system empowers faculty members to raise requests for invigilation swaps or schedule changes, which are processed through an intelligent approval workflow managed by the exam cell. Notifications and alerts are triggered in real-time, ensuring transparency and coordination among stakeholders. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js, handling RESTful API operations and business logic, while the ReactJS frontend provides an intuitive and responsive user interface. MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database for storing exam data, user information, and scheduling records efficiently. To enhance communication reliability, Nodemailer is integrated for sending email-based OTPs, approval or rejection alerts, and forgotten password recovery links. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is utilized to securely store faculty profile images, supporting scalability and centralized access. Role-based authentication ensures secure access for both admin and faculty users. This paper details the system’s architecture, implementation phases, and operational flow. It further demonstrates how automation minimizes manual intervention, reduces scheduling conflicts, ensures prompt notifications, and significantly improves administrative efficiency in exam management. The solution offers extensibility for future features such as mobile integration, AI-based invigilator recommendations, and analytics dashboards.
